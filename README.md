# Health Data Visualization Project 📊🌍

Welcome to the Health Data Visualization project! In this project, I analyzed a health dataset to derive key insights on cancer rates and life expectancy around the world 🌎. I used Excel for data cleaning and calculations, and Tableau to create visually engaging dashboards.

## 🧑‍💻 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation (Excel)** 🧹  
   I started by importing the health dataset into **Excel**. The data was cleaned and formatted, with filters applied to ensure accuracy. 

2. **Data Visualization (Tableau)** 📊  
   After preparing the dataset in Excel, I imported it into **Tableau** to create interactive and insightful visuals. Here are the three key visualizations:

   - **Average Lung Cancer Numbers per Continent and Gender** 🌍👩‍🦳👨‍🦳  
     This visual compares lung cancer rates across different continents and genders.

   - **Average Stomach Cancer Numbers per Continent** 🌍🦠  
     This chart shows the global distribution of stomach cancer rates by continent.

   - **Life Expectancy per Country** 🌐❤️  
     This map visualizes the average life expectancy in countries around the world.

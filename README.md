# Health Dataset Analysis 📊💪

Welcome to the Health Dataset Analysis project! In this project, I analyzed a health dataset to uncover insights related to lung cancer, stomach cancer, and life expectancy. I used Excel for data cleaning and Tableau for visualizing the results. 

## 🧑‍💻 Tools Used
- **Excel**: Used for cleaning, filtering, and formatting the dataset. I also used formulas to make necessary calculations.
- **Tableau**: Imported the cleaned data into Tableau to create 3 interactive visualizations.

## 📈 Visualizations & Insights

### 1. **Average Lung Cancer Numbers per Continent and Gender** 🌍
- **Visualization**: Displays the average number of lung cancer cases per continent and gender.
- **Insight**: Asia has the highest number of lung cancer cases among both genders.

### 2. **Average Stomach Cancer Numbers per Continent** 🍽️
- **Visualization**: Summarizes average stomach cancer numbers per continent.
- **Insight**: Asia also leads in the highest average stomach cancer cases.

### 3. **Life Expectancy per Country** 🌍🕰️
- **Visualization**: Shows life expectancy across different countries.
- **Insight**: Africa shows a lower life expectancy compared to Europe, highlighting potential disparities.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Lung Cancer**: Asia has the highest number of lung cancer cases, indicating a need for targeted awareness and healthcare programs in the region.
- **Stomach Cancer**: Similar to lung cancer, Asia leads in stomach cancer, calling for research and preventive strategies for digestive health.
- **Life Expectancy**: Africa lags behind Europe in life expectancy, which could be related to healthcare access and quality of life factors in the region.

## 💡 Recommendations
- **Asia (Lung & Stomach Cancer)**: Implement awareness campaigns focused on prevention and early detection of lung and stomach cancers. Enhance healthcare infrastructure and provide access to screenings.
- **Africa (Life Expectancy)**: Focus on improving healthcare access, nutrition, and sanitation to increase life expectancy. There should be global initiatives to invest in healthcare systems in African nations.
